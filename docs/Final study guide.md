# Final study guide

- The general concepts of stacks and queues and the key differences between them
- Basic operations for stacks and queues
- How to implement a stack via a simply linked list
- How to implement a stack via an array
- How to implement a queue via a simply linked list with a tail pointer
- How to implement a queue via a circular array (lab 7). Note the lab instuctions' conventions on front and back
- The general concept and mechanism of recursion, and a mental model of memory stack during recursive calls
- Basic recursive functions (based on some numerical parameter that decreases)
- Structure-based recursive functions (based on a structure like a list)
- Binary search trees, key properties, drawing such a tree
- Traversals of a binary tree (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
- Implementing recursive functions on trees
- Basics of writing tests
- Choosing good test cases
- Homeworks 11-13
