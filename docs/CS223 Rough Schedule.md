## Goals

- Have a working knowledge of the C++ programming language and essential aspects of object-oriented programming.
- Be able to describe and implement fundamental data structures, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of each.
- Be able to understand, implement and use abstract data types to solve problems.
- Be able to effectively use recursion to solve complex problems.
- Be able to write effective tests for program requirements, as well as use those tests to drive the programâ€™s development
